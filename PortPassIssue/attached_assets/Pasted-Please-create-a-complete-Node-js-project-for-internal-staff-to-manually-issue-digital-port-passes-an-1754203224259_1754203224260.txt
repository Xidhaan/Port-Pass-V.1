Features:

1. Frontend (served at `/`):
- An HTML form where staff enter each individual pass separately.
- Fields:
  - Full name (required)
  - Contact email (required, for reference only)
  - Pass type (dropdown):
    - Daily Pass (MVR 6.11) — requires ID card number (required)
    - Vehicle Sticker (MVR 11.21) — requires vehicle plate number (required)
    - Crane Lorry Vehicle Sticker Pass (MVR 81.51) — requires vehicle plate number (required)
  - Valid date (required)
  - Upload bank transfer slip file (required)
- The form dynamically shows/hides ID card or vehicle plate input based on selected pass type.
- On submission:
  - Generate a unique pass number.
  - Display a **print preview of the pass card** on-screen including:
    - Company logo
    - Customer name
    - Contact email
    - ID card number or vehicle plate (if applicable)
    - Pass type and valid date
    - Unique pass number
    - QR code encoding the pass number (using qrcode)

  - Provide buttons to:
    - **Open browser print dialog** for printing or saving as PDF.
    - Optionally, download the pass card as a PDF using browser print functionality.
- Store uploaded slips on the server in `/uploads/slips`.
- No backend PDF generation or automated emailing.

2. Backend (Express on port 3000 or environment port):
- Use multer for file uploads
- Use body-parser for form data
- Validate all fields depending on pass type; return errors if missing.
- Generate unique pass numbers.
- Save uploaded slips on server.
- Serve the printable pass data back to frontend for display.

3. Technologies:
- Express.js
- multer
- body-parser
- qrcode (for QR code generation as data URLs)

4. Additional:
- The printable pass card should be clean, professional, and suitable for direct printing or saving as PDF.
- QR code must encode the unique pass number.
- Clear frontend and backend validation.
- All passes handled individually and manually by staff.
- Contact email is for reference only.

Please generate all necessary source files with comments and instructions to install and run.
